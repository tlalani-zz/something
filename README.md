# rec-attendance-stats


This Github pages is for Chicago Primary CREC. To use you will need to login using the email and password for Primary CREC and then go through the options to find what you are looking for. I am currently working on updating all of the pages to have proper css so for the time being, some pages will not look very pretty. Once the changes are complete, this repo and the github pages will all be handed over to Chicago Primary CREC for use in the upcoming Religious Education school years.
